			<h2>findings</h2>
			<h3>Calls by Month</h3>
			<p>In Janaury, it has the most amount of calls.</p>
			<h2>Topic</h2>
			<p>The call about admin support has the highest resolved ratio, which is 74.08%. The customer satisfaction and average speed of answers for each topics have very slight difference.</p>
			<h3>Total Number of Answered Calls (# of answered)</h3>
			<p>Jim answered the highest number of calls, with a total of 536.<br>
			Dan is a close second with 523 calls answered.<br>
			Stewart answered the fewest calls, with a total of 477.</p>
			<h3>Total Number of Resolved Calls (# of resolved)</h3>
			<p>Jim also leads in the number of resolved calls, with a total of 485.<br>
			Dan resolved 471 calls, ranking second.<br>
			Stewart resolved the fewest calls, with 424.</p>
			<h3>Average Speed of Answer in Seconds</h3>
			<p>Joe has the longest average speed of answer, at 70.99 seconds.<br>
			Becky has the shortest average speed of answer, at 65.33 seconds.</p>
			<h3>Average Customer Satisfaction Rating</h3>
			<p>Martha has the highest average customer satisfaction rating, at 3.47.<br>
			Dan has the second-highest customer satisfaction rating, at 3.45.<br>
			Joe has the lowest customer satisfaction rating, at 3.33.</p>
			<h3>Call Resolution Rate</h3>
			<p>5/8 of agents have a resolution rate close to or slightly above 90%.</p>
			<h3>Correlation Between Response Time and Satisfaction</h3>
			<p>Generally, a shorter response time may correlate with higher customer satisfaction. However, Becky, despite having the fastest response time, does not have the highest satisfaction rating, indicating that other factors also affect customer satisfaction.</p>
			<h3>Overall Agent Performance</h3>
			<p>Dan stands out in terms of both the number of calls answered and resolved, and has a high customer satisfaction rating, possibly making him the top-performing agent.<br>
			Stewart has the fewest calls answered and resolved, and further analysis may be needed to understand the reasons.</p>
