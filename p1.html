	<h1>BCG - Climate & Sustainability Job Simulation</h1>

<h2>Setting the Baseline</h2>

<p><strong>Client</strong>: Fast Cars<br/><strong>Motivation</strong> for consulting service:<br/>- client is under pressure from investors to address climate change
- new government regulations are expected to force a phase-out of Internal Combustion Engine used in their cars.
- They have set carbon emission reduction targets using SBTi, but it&#39;s at the beginning phase.
<strong>Task</strong>: help them deliver on their Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) pledge to reduce their carbon emissions<br/><strong>Context</strong>: Fast Cars has committed to net-zero scope 1 and 2 GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions reduction by 2030 (from a 2018 base). Fast Cars has not yet committed to reducing its scope 3 GHG emissions but is considering doing so.<br/><em>scope 1: direct emissions from owned or controlled sources<br/>scope 2: indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the reporting company<br/>scope 3: all other indirect emissions that occur in a company&#39;s value chain</em>

<h2>Context and Benchmarking</h2>

<h3>benchmark our client Fast Cars&#39; position in the market</h3>

<p><img alt="image" src="https://github.com/YaoxiY/forage-bcg/assets/83184113/521f2e86-b320-4408-b651-d7b87e78e050"/>
Fast Cars scored B in CDP&#39;s 2020 results. <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/companies/companies-scores">CDP report</a><br/><img alt="image" src="https://github.com/YaoxiY/forage-bcg/assets/83184113/9b6be189-388e-47c3-bd69-a016aa6db721"/>
I fetched data from CDP and studied 35 companies in the automotive industry. As is shown in the table, the mode is A-, 71.4% companies score better than the client, 8.6% companies have the same score as the client, 20% companies score worse than the client. In brief, Fast Cars was in a low position in the automotive industry.</p>

<h2>Costs and Benefits</h2>

<p>Since the client has a limited budget, we must prioritize initiatives that will have the greatest impact and return on investment. At BCG, we often use abatement cost curve to demonstrate a &quot;step ladder&quot; pathway to net zero.</p>

- <strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>: Upgrading to energy-saving technologies and optimizing processes can significantly reduce a client&#39;s electricity consumption, leading to lower emissions from the power grid.
- <strong>Renewable Energy Purchases</strong>: Buying renewable energy certificates or investing in green energy projects helps client offset its carbon footprint, supporting cleaner electricity generation and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
- <strong>Onsite Renewable Generation</strong>: Installing solar panels or wind turbines allows the client to generate its clean power, cutting emissions from both purchased electricity and onsite gas boilers.

- <strong>Renewable Energy Contracts</strong>: Securing renewable energy contracts ensures the client&#39;s electricity comes from clean sources, directly reducing emissions associated with purchased power.
-<strong>Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)</strong>: Investing in CCS technologies captures and stores CO2 emissions, contributing to an overall reduction in client&#39;s carbon emissions, though not directly targeting onsite gas boilers or purchased electricity.
<a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/drive-electric-cars-to-the-tipping-point">BCG, Who Will Drive Electric Cars to the Tipping Point</a><br/>- <strong>Electrification</strong>: The client can reduce emissions by transitioning their vehicle fleet to electric models, which directly cuts reliance on fossil fuels and decreases the carbon footprint associated with electricity and gas boilers.
- <strong>Charging Infrastructure</strong>: Developing a widespread EV charging network encourages consumer adoption of electric cars, reducing the overall demand for gasoline and indirectly lowering emissions from the client&#39;s manufacturing processes.
- <strong>Battery Innovation</strong>: Investing in advanced battery technology can make EVs more competitive by increasing range and reducing costs, which accelerates the shift to electric mobility and contributes to a lower-emission automotive industry.
<a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/green-factory-of-future">The Green Factory of the Future</a><br/>- <strong>Energy Management Systems</strong>: The client can install systems to monitor and control energy use, leading to more efficient electricity and gas consumption and reduced emissions.
- <strong>Renewable Energy Integration</strong>: By incorporating renewable energy sources, the client can decrease dependence on fossil fuel-based electricity and lower emissions from onsite gas boilers.
- <strong>Process Optimization and Automation</strong>: The client should optimize manufacturing processes and adopt automation to minimize energy-intensive tasks, thereby reducing overall emissions from their operations.<br/><a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/stories/pioneers-in-climate-friendlyvehicle-manufacturing-6428">Pioneers in climate-friendly vehicle manufacturing</a><br/>- <strong>Production of Fully Electric Vehicles (FEVs)</strong>: The client can focus on manufacturing FEVs, like Volkswagen&#39;s ID.4, which are designed to have a neutral CO2 balance sheet, reducing the carbon footprint of their vehicle lineup.
- <strong>Utilization of Renewable Energy</strong>: The client should consider sourcing green electricity from renewable sources such as hydroelectric, wind, and solar power, as Volkswagen does, to minimize the reliance on fossil fuel-generated electricity.
- <strong>Energy-Efficient Infrastructure</strong>: The client can invest in energy-efficient facilities, similar to Volkswagen&#39;s combined heat and power plant in Zwickau, which uses natural gas more efficiently than coal and covers a significant portion of heating needs.</p>

<h4>recommended interventions</h4>

<ul><li><strong>Supply Chain Optimization</strong>: By choosing sustainable suppliers and optimizing logistics, the client can minimize its carbon footprint across the entire operation, leading to cost savings and efficiency.</li><li><strong>Onsite Renewable Generation</strong>: Generating clean power through solar or wind reduces reliance on fossil-fueled electricity, directly lowering emissions from both purchased power and onsite energy use.</li><li><strong>Production of Fully Electric Vehicles (FEVs)</strong>: Transitioning to FEVs like Volkswagen&#39;s ID.4 reduces the carbon footprint of the vehicle lineup, aligning with the global shift towards sustainable transportation and setting the company as an industry leader in emissions reduction.</li></ul>

<h2>Adding Value</h2>

<h3>sum of upstream/downstream emissions</h3>

<p><img alt="image" src="https://github.com/YaoxiY/forage-bcg/assets/83184113/c03924e2-11a9-4394-8821-170896f30704"/></p>

<strong>Findings</strong>
- All companies are focusing on reducing emissions from the use of sold products, which is a significant component of their overall Scope 3 emissions.
- The targets are set for different timeframes, with the earliest being by 2030 and the latest by 2035.
- BMW Group is unique in this group for also addressing emissions from purchased goods and services, as well as upstream transportation and distribution services.
- The targets vary in percentage, with Volvo Car Group having the highest reduction target at 52%, and Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. having the lowest at 32.5%.</p>

<h3>Key initiatives to consider</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Sustainable Design</strong>: Incorporate eco-friendly materials and design vehicles for longevity and recyclability, minimizing emissions from production and disposal.</li><li><strong>Supply Chain Management</strong>: Collaborate with suppliers to set emission reduction targets, prioritize low-carbon materials, and optimize logistics to cut transportation-related emissions.</li><li><strong>End-of-Life Vehicle Processing</strong>: Improve recycling programs and invest in advanced recycling technologies to efficiently recover materials from end-of-life vehicles, reducing waste-related emissions.</li></ul>

<h2>Risks and Opportunities</h2>
